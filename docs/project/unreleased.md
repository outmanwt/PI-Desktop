# Unreleased changes

- Resuming a subagent no longer selects another definition's private model
  binding. On-demand delegation permissions are checked again on the next parent
  turn, so revoking automatic delegation takes effect without restarting the runtime.
- Trusted extension cancellation now retires SDK commands, tool updates,
  subprocesses and queued or visible prompts. Late hook payload mutations are
  isolated; legitimate long commands and tools retain their runtime budget.

- A stored hosted web-search record that cannot be replayed no longer fails every
  later request in that conversation: the message continues without search replay,
  so histories written before the contract change stay usable.

- Hosted web search now has a complete replay and estimation contract, including
  tool/Task continuation and restart recovery. Context rebuilding preserves
  system-prefix semantics, and structured local preparation failures no longer
  masquerade as retryable provider failures. Existing search histories need no migration.

- Trusted extension startup, shutdown, and notification handlers now have
  bounded waits. Stop cancels pending hook waits before a model request, and
  disposal ignores late results and runs shutdown once. Deferred event
  registrations now appear in plugin diagnostics.
